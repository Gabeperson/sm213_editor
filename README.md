SM213 is a web-based code editor hosted [here](https://gabeperson.github.io/sm213_editor/). It uses SM213 parser to provide live syntactic error reporting as you code.

## Features
- **Live error reporting:** Potential syntactic errors in your command are displayed as you code so that you can catch mistakes as soon as they happen. Error messages are descritive so that you can find the error easily.
- **Browser-based:** You don't need to install anything to run. Just go to [https://gabeperson.github.io/sm213_editor/](https://gabeperson.github.io/sm213_editor/) and start writing.
- **Different color modes:** Currently supports light and dark mode. Provides the option to adjust the color theme to your system's default.
